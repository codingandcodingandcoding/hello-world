# hello-world
I'm making this description of this fake repository for the purpose of the tutorial. 
My name is codingandcodingandcoding. I am not sure I want to be a real coder one day, but I am very much interested in the tech world and would like to possibly start a health tech company. All this is really enjoyable for me, so I'm going to keep on with it.
